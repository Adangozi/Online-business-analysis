# CLOTHING E-COMMERCE(Power BI Interactive dashboard) 
## Project Description 
This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written 
by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through 
its multiple dimensions. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and 
references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”.
